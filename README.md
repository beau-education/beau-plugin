# Beau Plugin for Claude Code

A Claude Code plugin for creating educational resources on the [Beau](https://beau.bot) platform. This plugin gives Claude the knowledge and tools to author resources, upload images, create quizzes, and organize courses - all delivered by voice to students.

## What This Plugin Provides

- **MCP Server Connection**: Connects to the Beau API for resource management (create/update resources, upload images, create quizzes, manage courses)
- **Authoring Skill**: The `create-resource` skill teaches Claude how to structure educational resources with proper markdown syntax for embedding images and quizzes
- **Evaluation Skill**: The `evaluate-student` skill helps analyse student performance across courses

## Installation

In Claude Code:
```
/install-plugin dselman/beaubot-plugin
```

## Usage

Once installed, invoke the skills:
```
/beaubot:create-resource
/beaubot:evaluate-student
```

Claude will guide you through creating a resource by asking about the topic, audience, delivery mode, and learning objectives. It then uses the MCP tools to create the resource, upload images, create quizzes, and embed everything into the content.

## Key Concepts

- **Resource**: A self-contained learning unit with markdown content, images, and quizzes
- **Course**: A collection of resources organized for students to complete
- **Delivery Mode**: How the resource is presented - `conversation` (two-way voice) or `presentation` (one-way narration)
- **Quiz**: Structured assessment with single choice, multiple choice, or open answer questions
