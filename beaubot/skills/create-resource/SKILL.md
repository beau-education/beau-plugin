# Create Resource Skill

This skill helps you create educational resources for the Beau platform. Resources are the building blocks of your curriculum - each is a self-contained learning unit delivered by AI bots to students via voice conversation or presentation mode. Resources are grouped into courses.

## Instructions for Claude

When this skill is invoked, follow these steps:

0. **Preflight Check**: Verify the beaubot MCP server is connected by calling `list_tags(pageSize: 1)`. If this fails with a tool error, tell the user: "The Beau MCP server is not connected. Please check your MCP connection and authenticate if prompted." Then stop.

1. **Tag Governance** (before creating anything):
   a. Call `list_tags(pageSize: 50)` to fetch the full tag catalog
   b. Reuse existing tags where possible — do not create near-duplicates (e.g. "maths" vs "math")
   c. For genuinely new tags: ask the user to confirm, then call `create_tag(name)` to add them
   d. Only use tags that exist in the catalog when calling `create_resource`

1. **Gather Requirements**: Ask the user about:
   - Topic/subject for the resource
   - Target audience (age, skill level)
   - Delivery mode preference (conversation or presentation)
   - Desired length (default: 5-10 minutes)
   - Any specific learning objectives
   - Whether they want AI-generated images or have URLs to images/PDFs

2. **Design the Resource**: Based on the guides, create a structure with:
   - Clear learning objectives
   - Logical sections with headings
   - **A quiz after every major concept or section** — aim for at least 2-3 quizzes per resource. Quizzes are the primary way students actively engage with the material, and lessons without them feel passive and text-heavy.
   - **At least 1-2 images per resource** — visuals break up text, illustrate concepts, and give the bot something concrete to discuss with the student. A resource with no images is almost always too text-heavy.
   - Mix quiz types for variety (single choice, multiple choice, open answer, fraction, ordered list, matching)

3. **Create Content**: Draft the markdown content following best practices:
   - Write instructions for the bot, not a script
   - Use "the student" with they/them pronouns
   - Keep sections digestible
   - **IMPORTANT: Avoid text-heavy resources.** Every section should either have a quiz, an image, or both. If a section is just text with no interactivity, consider adding a quick quiz to check understanding or an image to illustrate the concept. Students learn best when they actively participate, not passively listen.

4. **Source Media**: Find or create visuals for the resource. **Every resource should have images** — they are essential for engagement, not optional decoration.
   - **Do NOT generate images via Python/code** — this is too slow and produces poor results
   - **Use `create_text_image`** for vocabulary cards, sight words, labels, math expressions — instant, no API key needed
   - **Use `generate_image`** for custom educational illustrations — server-side AI generation, fast, no base64 overhead
   - **Use `upload_image_from_url`** for existing public images (Wikimedia, educational sites)
   - **Use `create_image` (base64) only as a last resort** for user-provided local files
   - **Verify every image**: After generation/upload, view the image to confirm it matches intent
   - Write description/question/answer/hint based on what the image ACTUALLY shows, not what you intended
   - For PDFs: description is critical since the bot cannot read PDF content

5. **Execute Creation**: Use MCP tools to:
   - Create the resource via `create_resource`
   - Upload any media files via `upload_image_from_url` or `create_image`
   - Create quizzes via `create_quiz`
   - **CRITICAL**: Update resource content via `update_resource` to embed image and quiz references using the correct markdown syntax (see below)
   - Optionally create a course and add the resource to it

6. **Provide Testing Instructions**: Tell the user how to test their resource using the Test Resource button in the admin UI

### Resource Archive Format (for import/export)

The ZIP file **must** have all files at the root level (no subdirectory wrapper) with this structure:

```
manifest.json        # Required: metadata and file references
content.md           # Required: markdown content with portable tokens
media/               # Media files (images, videos, PDFs)
  media-001.png
  media-002.jpeg
quizzes/             # Quiz definitions
  quiz-001.json
  quiz-002.json
```

**CRITICAL**: Files must be at the ZIP root — NOT inside a subdirectory. A ZIP containing `my-resource/manifest.json` will fail; it must be just `manifest.json`.

#### manifest.json format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "exportedAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "resource": {
    "name": "Subtraction on a Number Line",
    "tags": ["maths", "subtraction"],
    "deliveryMode": "conversation"
  },
  "media": [
    {
      "ref": "media-001",
      "filename": "media/media-001.png",
      "name": "Number Line Diagram",
      "mimeType": "image/png",
      "description": "A number line showing 15 - 3 = 12",
      "question": "Where do we land after 3 hops back from 15?",
      "answer": "We land on 12",
      "hint": "Count the arrows backwards",
      "order": null,
      "botVisible": true
    }
  ],
  "quizzes": [
    {
      "ref": "quiz-001",
      "filename": "quizzes/quiz-001.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Key rules:
- `version` must be `1`
- `media` and `quizzes` are **arrays** (not objects)
- Each media entry must have a `ref` field (e.g. `"media-001"`) matching its portable token in content.md
- Each quiz entry must have a `ref` field (e.g. `"quiz-001"`) matching its portable token in content.md
- Media filenames must match their `mimeType` extension (e.g. `media-001.png` for `image/png`)
- Only `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, and `application/pdf` are supported for images

#### content.md portable tokens

Content must use portable `media://` and `quiz` tokens (NOT database IDs):

```markdown
![media-001](media://media-001)

::quiz{#quiz-001}
```

The importer replaces these tokens with real database IDs after creating the records.

#### Quiz JSON format

Each quiz file (e.g. `quizzes/quiz-001.json`) contains:

```json
{
  "question": "What is 15 - 3?",
  "questionType": "freetext",
  "inputRestriction": "integer",
  "expectedAnswer": "12",
  "numericMin": 0,
  "numericMax": 20,
  "allowNegative": false,
  "evaluationCriteria": "Accept only the number 12.",
  "retryLimit": 3,
  "hint": "Start at 15 and count back 3 hops.",
  "description": "Quiz after the number line example."
}
```

**create_tag:**
- `name` (required): Tag name to create (max 128 chars, lowercase recommended)

**list_course_resources:**
- `courseId` (required): The course ID to list resources for
- Returns: Ordered list of resources with name, tags, order, and bot details (content stripped to save tokens)

**add_resource_to_course:**
- `courseId` (required): Course ID
- `resourceId` (required): Resource ID to add
- `order` (optional): Position in the course (important for sequential courses)
- `bot` (optional): Override the course's default bot for this specific resource
- `deliveryMode` (optional): Override the resource's default delivery mode within this course

## Organizing Resources into Courses

Courses group related resources together for students to complete. When creating a course, consider:

### Progression Types

| Type | Behavior | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Flexible** | Students complete resources in any order | Independent topics, reference materials |
| **Sequential** | Students must follow the specified order | Prerequisite content, building-block skills |
| **Random** | System selects the next resource | Practice drills, varied review |

### Course Design Tips

- **Use sequential progression** when earlier resources teach concepts needed for later ones
- **Use flexible progression** when resources cover independent topics within a theme
- **Set resource order** carefully for sequential courses - use the `order` parameter in `add_resource_to_course`
- **Override the bot** for specific resources if a different AI persona or expertise is needed
- **Override delivery mode** per resource if some topics work better as conversation vs presentation
- **Keep courses focused** - 3-8 resources per course is a good range
- **Use consistent tags** across resources and courses for easy organization

### Open Enrollment

Enable open enrollment to let students self-enroll from the course catalog:
- Requires a `defaultTeacher` to be assigned for managing self-enrolled students
- Optionally set `maxEnrollments` to cap capacity
- Set `teacherOnly: true` to preview the course before releasing to students

### Paid Courses

If the organization has Stripe Connect configured:
- Set `priceCents` and `currency` to create a paid course
- Open enrollment must be enabled for paid courses
- Students go through Stripe checkout and are automatically enrolled after payment

## CRITICAL: Embedding Media and Quizzes in Resource Content

After creating images and quizzes, you **MUST** update the resource content to include references to them. Without these references, the bot will NOT display the media or quizzes during delivery.

### Image Reference Syntax

```markdown
![IMAGE_ID](/api/v1/images/IMAGE_ID/data)
```

Example: If `create_image` returns `{ id: 156 }`, insert:
```markdown
![156](/api/v1/images/156/data)
```

### Quiz Reference Syntax

```markdown
::quiz{#QUIZ_ID}
```

Example: If `create_quiz` returns `{ id: 28 }`, insert:
```markdown
::quiz{#28}
```

### Complete Example

```
# Step 1: Create resource
create_resource(
  name: "Introduction to Photosynthesis",
  content: "# Learning Objectives\n\nPlaceholder content...",
  tags: ["science", "biology"],
  deliveryMode: "conversation"
)
# Response: { id: 42, ... }

# Step 2: Upload image from URL
upload_image_from_url(
  resourceId: 42,
  url: "https://example.com/plant-cell.png",
  name: "Plant Cell Diagram",
  description: "Diagram of a plant cell showing chloroplasts",
  question: "Where does photosynthesis occur?",
  answer: "In the chloroplasts",
  hint: "Look for the green organelles",
  botVisible: true
)
# Response: { id: 156, ... }

# Step 3: Create quiz
create_quiz(
  resourceId: 42,
  description: "Test understanding of photosynthesis location",
  question: "In which organelle does photosynthesis take place?",
  questionType: "single",
  answers: [
    { id: "a", text: "Mitochondria", isCorrect: false },
    { id: "b", text: "Chloroplast", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "c", text: "Nucleus", isCorrect: false }
  ],
  retryLimit: 2,
  hint: "It contains chlorophyll, which is green"
)
# Response: { id: 28, ... }

# Step 4: CRITICAL - Update resource with image and quiz references
update_resource(
  id: 42,
  content: "# Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this resource, the student should understand photosynthesis.\n\n## What is Photosynthesis?\n\nExplain that plants convert sunlight into energy. Show the diagram:\n\n![156](/api/v1/images/156/data)\n\nDiscuss the diagram with the student.\n\n## Check Understanding\n\nNow test the student's knowledge:\n\n::quiz{#28}\n\n## Summary\n\nReview the key points."
)
```

## Quiz Types

### Single Choice
```json
{
  "question": "What gas do plants absorb?",
  "questionType": "single",
  "answers": [
    { "id": "a", "text": "Oxygen", "isCorrect": false },
    { "id": "b", "text": "Carbon dioxide", "isCorrect": true }
  ],
  "hint": "Think about what humans breathe out"
}
```

### Multiple Choice
```json
{
  "question": "Select ALL ingredients for photosynthesis",
  "questionType": "multiple",
  "answers": [
    { "id": "a", "text": "Sunlight", "isCorrect": true },
    { "id": "b", "text": "Water", "isCorrect": true },
    { "id": "c", "text": "Oxygen", "isCorrect": false }
  ]
}
```

### Open Answer
```json
{
  "question": "Calculate 15% of 80",
  "questionType": "freetext",
  "inputRestriction": "decimal",
  "expectedAnswer": "12",
  "evaluationCriteria": "Accept 12, 12.0, or 12.00"
}
```

### Fraction
```json
{
  "question": "What is 1/2 + 1/6?",
  "questionType": "freetext",
  "inputRestriction": "fraction",
  "expectedAnswer": "2/3",
  "numericMin": 0,
  "numericMax": 1,
  "allowNegative": false,
  "evaluationCriteria": "Accept equivalent fractions (e.g. 4/6, 8/12)"
}
```

### Ordered List
Students drag and drop items into the correct sequence. The answers array order defines the correct sequence — students see items shuffled.
```json
{
  "question": "Put these in order from smallest to largest",
  "questionType": "ordered_list",
  "answers": [
    { "id": "a", "text": "1/2", "isCorrect": false },
    { "id": "b", "text": "0.55", "isCorrect": false },
    { "id": "c", "text": "3/5", "isCorrect": false },
    { "id": "d", "text": "62%", "isCorrect": false }
  ],
  "hint": "Convert everything to decimals to compare"
}
```
Note: `isCorrect` is ignored for ordered_list — the array order IS the correct answer. Minimum 2 items, maximum 10.

### Matching
Students match items from two columns. The left column shows fixed terms, the right column shows shuffled matches that students drag to align correctly.
```json
{
  "question": "Match each part of speech to its example",
  "questionType": "matching",
  "answers": [
    { "id": "a", "text": "verb", "isCorrect": false, "matchText": "jump" },
    { "id": "b", "text": "noun", "isCorrect": false, "matchText": "book" },
    { "id": "c", "text": "adverb", "isCorrect": false, "matchText": "quickly" }
  ],
  "hint": "Think about what each word does in a sentence"
}
```
Note: `isCorrect` is ignored for matching — correct state is when each answer's `matchText` is aligned next to its `text`. Each answer needs both `text` (term) and `matchText` (match). Minimum 2 pairs, maximum 10.

### Fill in the Blank
Students fill in missing words within a sentence. Supports free text input or word bank (dropdown) mode.
```json
{
  "question": "Water freezes at [] degrees Celsius and boils at [] degrees Celsius",
  "questionType": "fill_in_blank",
  "answers": [
    { "id": "a", "text": "0", "isCorrect": true },
    { "id": "b", "text": "100", "isCorrect": true }
  ],
  "hint": "Think about the states of water"
}
```
For word bank mode (dropdown with distractors), set `inputRestriction` to `"word_bank"` and add distractor answers with `isCorrect: false`:
```json
{
  "question": "The [] sat on the []",
  "questionType": "fill_in_blank",
  "inputRestriction": "word_bank",
  "answers": [
    { "id": "a", "text": "cat", "isCorrect": true },
    { "id": "b", "text": "mat", "isCorrect": true },
    { "id": "c", "text": "dog", "isCorrect": false },
    { "id": "d", "text": "hat", "isCorrect": false }
  ]
}
```
Note: Use `[]` in the question to mark blank positions. Correct answers (`isCorrect: true`) map in order to blanks. Distractors (`isCorrect: false`) appear as extra options in word bank mode. Minimum 1 blank.

## Image Creation Speed

**NEVER generate images via Python/code execution** (matplotlib, PIL, etc.) — this is extremely slow, produces poor results, and sends huge base64 payloads through MCP.

Instead, use these server-side tools in order of preference:

1. **`create_text_image`** — for words, phrases, vocabulary cards, sight words, labels, math expressions. Instant, no API key needed, deterministic rendering.
2. **`generate_image`** — for custom educational illustrations, diagrams, scenes. Uses the org's OpenAI API key for server-side AI generation. Fast, no client-side overhead.
3. **`upload_image_from_url`** — for publicly hosted images from Wikimedia, educational sites, etc.
4. **`create_image` (base64)** — last resort only, for user-provided local files.

## Image Metadata Accuracy

**Use `get_image(imageId)` to inspect every image before setting metadata.** AI-generated images may not match your prompt exactly.

- Write `description`, `question`, `answer`, and `hint` based on what the image ACTUALLY shows, not what you intended
- If the image doesn't match your intent, regenerate it or adjust the metadata to match reality

**Bad example** (metadata written from intent, not inspection):
```
generate_image(prompt: "A number line showing 5 + 3 = 8")
# Sets metadata WITHOUT viewing the result:
description: "Number line showing 5 + 3 = 8"  # ← May not match actual image
```

**Good example** (metadata written after inspection):
```
generate_image(prompt: "A number line showing 5 + 3 = 8")
# Views the returned image, sees it actually shows a number line 0-10 with an arrow from 5 to 8
description: "A number line from 0 to 10 with an arrow jumping from 5 to 8"
question: "What number does the arrow land on?"
answer: "8"
```

## Tag Governance

**Always call `list_tags` before assigning tags to resources.** This prevents tag sprawl and keeps the organization's tag catalog clean.

### Rules
- Reuse existing tags — don't create near-duplicates ("maths" vs "math", "Year 1" vs "year-1")
- Ask the user before creating new tags via `create_tag`
- Naming conventions: lowercase, hyphens for multi-word (e.g. "year-3", "key-stage-2", "number-bonds")
- Prefer broader tags over hyper-specific ones ("fractions" not "adding-unit-fractions-year-4")

### Example flow
```
# Step 1: Check existing tags
list_tags(pageSize: 50)
# → Items: [{ name: "maths" }, { name: "year-3" }, { name: "fractions" }]

# Step 2: User wants a resource tagged "maths", "year-3", "number-line"
# "maths" and "year-3" exist. "number-line" is new.
# → Ask user: "The tag 'number-line' doesn't exist yet. Shall I create it?"

# Step 3: User confirms
create_tag(name: "number-line")

# Step 4: Create resource with all tags from catalog
create_resource(name: "...", content: "...", tags: ["maths", "year-3", "number-line"])
```

## Best Practices

1. **Write for the bot, not the student** - The bot interprets your instructions and delivers them conversationally
2. **Use clear headings** - Structure content with `#`, `##`, `###` for pacing
3. **Keep resources short** - 5-10 minutes is ideal per resource; split longer content into multiple resources within a course
4. **Include plenty of quizzes** - Aim for **at least 2-3 quizzes per resource**, placed after each major concept. Quizzes are the primary way to keep students actively engaged. A resource with fewer than 2 quizzes almost always feels too passive. Use a variety of quiz types (single choice, multiple choice, open answer, fraction, ordered list, matching) to keep things interesting.
5. **Include images in every resource** - Aim for **at least 1-2 images per resource**. Visuals break up text, illustrate concepts, and give the bot concrete material to discuss. Text-only resources feel dry and lecture-like.
6. **Provide accurate media metadata** - View every image before setting description, question, answer, and hint. Write metadata for what the image actually shows, not what you intended.
7. **Enable botVisible for important images** - Let the bot see diagrams and charts
8. **Always embed references** - Images need `![ID](/api/v1/images/ID/data)` and quizzes need `::quiz{#ID}` in the content
9. **Design resources to be self-contained** - Each resource should make sense on its own and be reusable across courses
10. **Avoid text-heavy content** - If any section of your resource is more than a few sentences without a quiz or image, it's probably too text-heavy. Add interactivity.
11. **Test your resources** - Use the Test Resource feature in the admin UI before assigning to students
12. **Always call `list_tags` before assigning tags** - Reuse existing tags and only create new ones (via `create_tag`) with user confirmation.
13. **Verify image content before writing metadata** - AI-generated images may not match your prompt exactly. View the image first.
14. **Never run Python or other code to generate images** - Use `create_text_image` for words/phrases, `generate_image` for custom illustrations, `upload_image_from_url` for public images.
